DATABASE INFORMATION:
The database for this project was created and maintained using the MariaDB client.

There are two tables in this database, called `accounts` and `contacts`.
	> `accounts` stores the user accounts that have been created by registering.
	> `contacts` stores the contacts that accounts make on the site.

Here are the attributes for `accounts`:
	> userID (int) (auto increment) (primary key)
	> username (string)
	> password (string)
	> firstName (string)
	> lastName (string)
	> email (string)
	> phoneNumber (string)

Here are the attributes for `contacts`:
	> contactID (int) (auto increment) (primary key)
	> userID (int)
	> firstName (string)
	> lastName (string)
	> email (string)
	> phoneNumber (string)
	> dateCreated (datetime) (automatically sets to current timestamp)


In an entity-relationship diagram (ERD), these two tables would share a relationship, that being `accounts` <CREATES> `contacts`. However, since this is a one-to-many relationship (one account can have many contacts, but one contact cannot have many accounts), the relationship table that would exist has been fused to the `contacts` table, so that each contact is linked to the userID that created it.
